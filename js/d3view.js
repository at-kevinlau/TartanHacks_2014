The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function. But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values. This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type. One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Students will make regular presentations, and will be evaluated on the code delivered, software engineering process, client satisfaction, and their contribution to the team. Students will leave the course with a firsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that drive SE practices. They will have concrete experience with these practices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this experience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to support immediate competency in a software engineering organization, along with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the new processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace.","title":"Software Engineering Practicum"},{"courseId":"15414","treeType":"OR","nodeId":46,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[47,21],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[52,53],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"Many CS and ECE students will be developing software and hardware that must be ultra reliable at some point in their careers.

Embedded systems vary tremendously, from the single 8-bit processor in a thermostat, to high performance processors in a digital camera, to dozens of networked processors in an automobile. Despite this diversity of applications, there are core technology and system-level skills needed by any embedded system designer that form the content of this course. The emphasis of this course will be at the system layer where hardware meets software, with plenty of hands-on experience at \u0026quot;bare metal\u0026quot; programming. Topics typically covered include embedded computing platforms (hardware, microcontroller instruction sets, software in both assembly language and C); interacting with the external world (analog I/O, digital I/O, serial ports, filtering, control, embedded networks); system-level engineering (design cycle, architectural patterns, peer reviews); real-time operation (timers, interrupts, concurrency, task switching, writing a simple RTOS kernel, scheduling); constraints and optimization (economics, power, performance); and a survey of techniques important for building systems that work in the real world (debug, test, robust design, dependability, safety, ethical/societal issues). Weekly hands-on hardware and software experiences with a 16-bit microcontroller module will tie directly to lectures to reinforce core skills. 4 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec., 3 hrs. lab.

Since the focus of energy conversion methods studied in this course is from electrical to mechanical systems, special attention is paid to electromagnetic theory. Rotating machines theory is developed and intuitively explained starting with Maxwell equations and analyzing general static and dynamic electromagnetic circuits. Power electronics methods are also introduced because most of modern electrical systems employ such methods.

Prerequisites: 15-410 and senior or graduate standing.","title":"Mobile and Pervasive Computing"},{"courseId":"18845","treeType":"OR","nodeId":250,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[72],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[283],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"This course investigates the issues involved in providing scalable and highly available network services over the best-effort Internet. Examples of such services include Web servers, application servers, search engines, proxy caches, online auction systems, and remote visualization. Topics include network programming, server design, clustering, caching, proxies, remote execution, resource naming, discovery, and monitoring, and wide-area metacomputing. The course consists of lectures on existing technology, student presentations of research papers, and a project where students design and implement a significant network service.

The first part introduces basic components and networks used in the electric power industry. This is followed by systematic modeling of these components, as well as of the entire system. Methods for modeling and analyzing both system equilibria and dynamics are presented. Simulations and lab demos are given to simulate and analyze typical system blackouts. This is followed by introducing decision and control methods for preventing these problems, as well as for managing the system more reliably, securely and efficiently over broad ranges of its operating conditions. The emphasis is on IT, software and control (both distributed and coordination) for achieving pre-specified system performance. This part of the course will involve simulation demos and hands on studies in which students create their own power network, simulate it and assess for performance. The second part of the course will review the industry structure, the experience with deregulatio n, and economic issues concerning choice of generating fuel and technology, the costs of blackouts, and environmental discharges. The course will integrate engineering and economic aspects to examine the design, investment, and operations that satisfy public desires for low cost, nonpolluting, reliable, and secure power. Knowledge of basic electric circuits and/or basic economics is assumed. 3 hrs. lec., 1 hr. rec.
