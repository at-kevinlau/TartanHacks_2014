Over the?first decade of the twenty-first century it has become clear that the form of urban settlement is driven by complex interacting systems, ecologies and economies resulting in a physical form that has surpassed our traditional notions of ?city? or ?landscape,? while producing highly unsustainable patterns of development with both ecological and cultural impacts. At the same time contemporary culture has evolved into a hyper-mediated, networked and globalized state which appears increasing unstable, creating both positive negative potentials. During this period the design professions have successfully integrated sustainability at the scale of buildings and products, however, the question of how to best do this at the urban scale remains open for debate. For those working at the scale of the city, one of the most promising recent attempts to reformulate design has been the conceptual merging of landscape and urbanism in to a hybrid practice of landscape, infrastructural or ecological urbanism which draws on analytical tools from sources such as geography and ecology to understand material, spatial and cultural flows. Over the first 10 weeks of the semester this seminar will explore this approach through readings, lectures and case studies. We will read from cultural geography, critical theory, sociology, anthropology, landscape ecology, architecture and landscape. Moving from theory to action, the final 5 weeks of class will be devoted to a speculative project exploring how the large scale systems of the urban landscape might be re-calibrated to create more dynamic or productive possibilities for the future of the city that could influence its future from and function.","title":"City as Landscape: Geography as Method and Metaphor"},{"courseId":"48426","treeType":"OR","nodeId":48,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"This seminar will focus on the merging of computational design, digital fabrication, and casting techniques, as a means of producing architectural components that assemble to form larger architectural systems.

Thanks to photography and cyber technology no longer is a representation revered as a unique or rarified object but a conglomeration of cultural influences. Nowadays images of the self and others, prompt viewers to consider a wide range of psychological, spiritual, and political information beyond visual manifestation. Two basic questions \u0026quot;Who are you?\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;What is art?\u0026quot; often come together in the contemporary portrait. Most likeness portrayals are negotiations between identity and representation, between being a subject and portraying a subject. Depictions of people represent a mark of contemporary life that personal identities have become fractured, complex, and splintered, and that they are in a state of constant re-definition.

Hybrid art forms expand the possibilities for experimentation and innovation in contemporary art. Drawing is the basis of most art forms, and has a direct connection with all modes of production. The objective of the course is to consider various ideas, materials, and art making processes used in contemporary visual arts through the use of painting, drawing, sculpture, installation and photography. Blurring boundaries, breaking rules, and creating hybrids occupies much artistic work today. However, making meaning in art (whatever tools, materials, or techniques are used) remains central to artistic practice. Redefining artwork through experimentation, focused exercises, and Technical expansion of various modes of artistic production, will expand their understanding of this hybrid studio practice.","title":"Advanced DP3: Special Topics"},{"courseId":"60474","treeType":"OR","nodeId":142,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"Bristle and Shutter is a studio /seminar that is one part film/painting screening and discussion, one part studio making and one part critique.

More and more contemporary artists are pushing beyond the conventional media and methods of the art world by strategically operating as \u0026quot;professional\u0026quot; amateurs. The term amateur reflects a voluntary motivation to create as a result of personal passion for a particular activity, regardless of expertise or authority. For the artist, embracing the role of the amateur allows for the use of any profession, institution, or social activity as a possible material within their creative practice. This includes artists who \u0026quot;perform\u0026quot; as amateur preachers, psychologists, geneticists, politicians, and exotic dancers; artists who create amateur institutions like sanitariums, circuses, hair salons, talk shows, and planetariums; and artists who collaborate with professional hypnotists, ornithologists, stunt coordinators, ventriloquists, and diplomats in order to manifest their work. Students in this class will work on self-defined projects that utilize the role of the amateur as a critical method for expanding the breath and reach of their art practice into new forms and venues. With faculty mentorship, each student will be responsible for developing their projects through independent research, apprenticeships, and collaborations with experts in fields relevant to their work. Workshops, lectures, and in class critique of ongoing work will look at contemporary trends related to amateurism in art practice, theory, and the world at large. This class is not about being an amateur artist, but about being a serious artist who uses amateurism as a tool. Thus the class is only open to majors or non-majors who have already completed an Art studio course.","title":"Advanced CP: Special Topic"},{"courseId":"60492","treeType":"OR","nodeId":144,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"Inner Geographies: On Discovering the Inward Landscapes and Journeys of the Mind and Body This course will discover and explore the inward subconscious topologies of perception, thought (logics), memory, imagination, intuition, the hypnogogic (between dream and waking), dreaming, telepathy, meditation and trance in relation to artistic and other forms of creativity (writing, science, and technologies).

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors.

Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence.

He later wrote: ?I have read carefully eleven of Shakespeare\u0027s plays during the spare hours of the voyage?They are such gems. I?feel as if I have made new friends, whose angel visits will do me good in days and nights to come?..everything has its ?environment,? and Shakespeare is the environment of all English-speaking men.? Much has changed since Carnegie wrote those words, but many still hunger for an introduction to Shakespeare?s Tragedies and Histories like this one. Our reading list will include hauntingly powerful plays such as Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, Henry V, Richard II, 1 Henry IV, and Henry V. Students at the end of the course should expect to have a good grounding in the language, themes, and characters of Shakespearean Tragedies and Histories and perhaps more importantly be equipped to think carefully about Shakespeare?s plays in relation to poetics, topical politics, and genre.

Like Aristotle, during the past century rhetorical theorists including Kenneth Burke, Chaim Perelman, Stephen Toulmin, and Thomas Sloane have remarked on the close affinity between the rhetorical method and the casuistical one?based on analogical reasoning from paradigmatic past cases?and some have even proposed that we model a theory of argument on the case-based reasoning found in Anglo-American legal systems. In this course, we?ll explore the casuistical or case-based method of argument commonly used in law, business, and public policy schools and in various moral and ethical contexts including medical and bioethics, as well as the case study research methodology frequently used in the social sciences and practice-oriented disciplines such as law, business, and education. Alongside various examples of cases and case-based arguments, we?ll read rhetorical and interdisciplinary scholarship discussing the casuistical method, the relationship cases bear to general rules, theories, and principles, the role of ideology and narrative in case construction, and claims that case studies are invaluable for their ability to represent the unique qualities of a person, group, or situation.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, as pursued by Lewis Hine, while the other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz, founder of the elite Photo-Secession movement in the United States, who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul. As such they were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.

More specifically part 1 dwells on the general issue of the rhetorical nature of management discourse across time and space. Such a revisiting of management discourse is essential in order to avoid misunderstanding pitfalls misuse and abuse of managerial rhetoric when referring to cultural organizations. If management knowledge as developed in management studies is of some help part 2 aims at addressing the variety of knowledge and stream of research that could be relevant for analyzing cultural organization more than simply communication and fundraising as it is sometimes understood. A more thorough understanding of managerial discourse either in terms of the strategic approach knowledge management organization of labor HRM and similar issues is proposed here as a less superficial uses of management for arts organizations. Part 3 then moves more directly to the Italian arts sector. After introducing data for a preliminary description of the Italian context some of the major topics under discussion in Italy are addressed here. The focus is on the specifics of the Italian system i.e. the role of public sector in the arts. Major reform processes in this context are then investigated i.e. referring to reform inside the public sector tending to foster a managerial logic within public organizations (the so called process of \u0026quot;managerialization\u0026quot;).

This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type. One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function. Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

The binding projects will be: A hardcover for a paper back book, a single signature book, a multi-signature book with flat spine, and a box construction. The box project is designed and crafted to contain a small letterpress printed class edition, either in book form, or as a set of un-bound pages. The letterpress component teaches the standard issues, unique to the relief process, in press work, handset procedure of cast metal type, page form spacing, lock-up of pages in press, proofing, and production printing. Each semester a small class edition project of text content and image, in two-color registration, is designed, hand set and printed. Image generation can be by hand cut block, assembled type-high forms, or digital process to polymer plate.

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations. The emphasis is on process, not product -- devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development -- both of which are explored here. We also examine the work of several significant contemporary theater artists whose work approaches collaboration across a variety of disciplines. Artists have included: Ariane Mnouschkine, Dumbtype, Complicite, Ralph Lemon, Robert LePage, and more. Students learn to define and distinguish these artist?s approaches through viewing video excerpts, readings, and discussion.

We will first look at the Aiiieeeee! controversy, which pitted experimental Asian-American writers against popular authors such as Maxine Hong Kingston, in order to raise questions about gender, authorship, and literary form. We will then turn to issues of citizenship, the nation, and belonging by reading John Okada?s No-No Boy (1957) and Julie Otsuka?s When the Emperor was Divine (2002), both of which depict WWII internment camps. For a different perspective on identity, transnationalism, and immigration, we will read Amy Tan?s The Joy Luck Club (1989) and Jessica Hagedorn?s Dogeaters (1990). Each of these novels is in some way concerned with the porousness and tenuousness of Asian-American identity. The course also asks: Who can speak for Asian Americans? Chang-Rae Lee?s Native Speaker (1995) poses this question explicitly, while Robert Olen Butler?s A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain (1992) invites us to consider literary reception and cultural politics. How does Butler?s whiteness affect our understanding of his short story collection? Can his stories of Vietnamese experience be viewed as a form of Asian-American literature? To conclude the course we will read two novels that are formally innovative. These novels, Karen Tei Yamashita?s Tropic of Orange (1997) and Ruth Ozeki?s My Year of Meats (1998), are taken by critics such as Rachel Adams to be part of a new era of American literary globalism. Do Yamashita and Ozeki, then, signal the end of Asian-American literature as a discrete literary subfield? Or does Asian-American literature persist in the 21st century? To supplement our views on these novels, we will read criticism by Min Hyoung Song, Walter Benn Michaels, Patricia Chu, David Palumbo-Liu, Susan Koshy, and Lisa Lowe.","title":"What is Asian American Literature?"},{"courseId":"76211","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1472,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"Theater historian Joseph Roach has claimed that we are in the midst of a ?deep eighteenth century,? or ?the one that?s not over yet.?

The Restoration and British eighteenth century (1660 ? 1800) witnessed significant cultural changes like the reopening of the bawdy London theaters and the introduction of actresses onto the London stage in 1660; a growing urban population?and the resulting rise in crime and sexually-transmitted diseases; and an ongoing crisis about masculine valor. By exploring how modern identity categories like gender and sexuality emerged within this period, we can better understand the ?deep eighteenth century? as embedded within current cultural practices and beliefs. For instance, how did writers from the Restoration and Georgian periods chronicle sexual fluidity, and how does that affect our current interpretation of categories of gender and sex? How was the marriage market impacted by British colonialism and the shift from agrarianism to commercialism? In short, this course will explore how we are still surrounded by the ?deep eighteenth century? by investigating how writers like Aphra Behn, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan discuss modern identity categories of sexuality and gender (and more).

Spring 2014: For decades, communication researchers relying on stimulus-response theories associated a text with a single dominant stimulus evoking a single dominant response. This thinking widely influenced rhetorical understandings of language for decades as well. Today, rhetorical theories of language have discredited these behaviorist theories in favor of theories that see language as the constructors of situations rather than the effects of them. When speakers and writers use language, they resuscitate, enact, and perform worlds of experience from words. They create not only meanings but histories, identities, and social bids to initiate social change. This course introduces students to a theory and ontology of language study that is in keeping with language as a constructive activity. Students will learn to use software designed to analyze texts qualitatively and numerically from a constructive point of view. The software works as a microscope to help you see patterns of language use that escape the limited attention span of even the most painstaking of close readers. After learning how the software works, we will do exercises with small textual samples so that students can sharpen their powers of observing language across families of patterns. Students are encouraged to analyze the texts they love most -- from literature, politics, journalism, to their favorite blog posts, tweets, and Facebook posts.

For instance, are \u0026quot;all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state...secularized theological concepts\u0026quot;? Is war of humans\u0027 making (poesis) or of God\u0027s? If we treat angels, diplomats, and poems as early modern media, does the medium change the message? We will also consider questions of craft, technique, and poetics. One hypothesis is that verse technique mattered so much in the period due to the question of how power (verbal power, divine power, political power) should be represented and restrained. Biographically, many canonical poets we\u0027ll study worked as ambassadors, representing power abroad (Wyatt, Sidney, Donne, Marvell). Many more poets including Shakespeare and Milton thematized diplomacy, in both its divine and more worldly forms. Shakespeare considered his sonnets \u0026quot;written embassage[s].\u0026quot; Readings including Genesis, Shakespeare\u0027s Hamlet, Milton\u0027s Paradise Lost, and John Donne\u0027s \u0026quot;The Ecstasy\u0026quot; will be introduced and contextualized through writers such as Pseudo-Dionysius, John Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Alberico Gentili, and George Puttenham.

We see this, for example, in the increasing use of narrative in journalism, in the presentation of controversial historical events, in current political debates about immigration reform, and in workplace communication. In these contexts, narratives function as a source of authority and legitimation. To understand this function, we will discuss several key concepts in narrative theory, and then apply them to several case studies. We will look at how immigrant narratives circulating in the United States create stock images of immigrants as a threat; at how politicians use autobiographical narration to claim authority; and at how workplace narratives establish roles, boundaries, and power relations.

Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism\u0027s glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy.

As a seminar, the course will focus on three cases of the rapidly changing dialectic of orthodoxy and heterodoxy -- the French Revolution controversy that polarized British culture in the 1790s, the idealism/materialism debate that emerged after 1800 to help redefine the contours of knowledge-production, and the role of new print and oral media within which a new and lastingly influential idea of \u0026quot;literature\u0026quot; would emerge. In all three cases, we need to understand how deeply political and religious questions were entwined for these writers.

In a time when many forms of communication are digitally based, traveling as bits at e-speeds on global computer networks? To begin answering these questions, we will take as case studies several new discursive digital media formations, such as digital books, on-line newspapers, blogs, wikis, and so forth, along with related social formations, such as social media and distributed non-profit activist organizations. The readings will provide a range of lens by which to understand these developments, including cognitive, social, political, economic and technological aspects.

It asks: what are the social and cognitive processes, what are the conscious and unconscious problem-solving strategies we use: to comprehend and interpret text, to construct and communicate our own meanings, and to project or discover our readers\u0027 responses? In the first half of the course we look at writers and designers as thinkers and problem solvers?facing the challenge of equally creative, meaning-making readers and their own constructive, interpretive processes of comprehension. Understanding (and user-testing for) how readers actually interpret texts is critical to many kinds of writing, from informative websites and PR work, to persuasive applications and powerful arguments. An introduction to the research and theory on reading and writing as a social/cognitive process lets us explore the why behind the what readers do. For instance, you will learn how memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge can shape and are shaped by language and discourse as socially constructed mediating tools. At the same time you will develop a portfolio of methods that track the constructive, inferential process of readers\u0027 comprehension. In the second half of the course we turn to you and your own writing as a thinking process engaged in the constant effort to juggle competing goals. You will gain insight into your current problem-solving strategies and develop new ones for doing reader-based writing and design. The final project (which studies your own process on a current writing task) will expand your portfolio of methods into a toolkit of expert strategies for 1) both composing and communication and for 2) user testing and inquiry into the comprehension of real readers that uncovers how others actually interpret what you thought you said.","title":"Process of Reading and Writing"},{"courseId":"76427","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1525,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[298],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[1106],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"In Teaching Writing as Reflective Practice, George Hillocks identifies good teachers as those who treat their classrooms as sites of inquiry by constantly interrogating assumptions about what students need, experimenting with new techniques and strategies in order to meet those needs, and critically assessing whether these strategies are successful. In this seminar, we will implement Hillocks\u0027 philosophy by learning to think about our pedagogy as a research project, asking such questions as - What do students need to learn about writing? Are our classes helping students gain these skills? - Are there particular pedagogical strategies that seem more or less effective than others? - Do new advances in technology offer us new ways to improve our instruction? - How do students use (or not use) the knowledge they gain in writing classes in future contexts? - What unique needs do various groups of students have (e.g. students with learning disabilities, students from different linguistic or cultural backgrounds) that our pedagogy should work to accommodate? We will read recent research seeking to answer these questions and discuss how we can contribute to these conversations. In other words, we will focus both on learning about existing research and on producing research of our own. We will learn how to identify researchable questions, develop methods and research designs for answering those questions, and dig through the evidence we collect to come to more nuanced understandings of the questions we sought to answer.

This course will focus on American culture and society from the stock market crash of 1929 through the beginning of World War II. We will read literature, see films, and consider other artistic productions, and and we will also read social, economic, and political history. The 1930s in the U.S. saw a flourishing of the realism of proletarian fiction and the emergence of a new wave of naturalists such as Richard Wright and John Steinbeck. The rise of industrial unions produced what Michael Denning has defined as a \u0026quot;cultural front,\u0026quot; involving the first popular interest in American folk music and mass media representations of the working class. But the 1930s also saw the rise of the major studios and radio networks into what was later called \u0026quot;the culture industry,\u0026quot; and we will look at how those industries both addressed and diverted attention from the economic crisis. We will also consider at least briefly the relations of the U.S. and the rest of the world, looking especially at the rise of fascism and Hitler, the role of the Soviet Union in the international Communist movement, and the Spanish Civil War where these two forces fought it out with each other.","title":"American Culture of the Great Depression"},{"courseId":"76439","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1527,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"During Hollywood\u0027s \u0026quot;Classic Era,\u0026quot; roughly 1920-1960, film production was focused on a relatively few genres, which served both aesthetic and marketing functions. Though for a time beginning in 1960s, many critics looked down on genre films, preferring such seeming outliers as Citizen Kane, it is now widely recognized that genre films are what defined the era\u0027s classicism. This course will look at the genres of that era through the lens of Howard Hawks, who has been called \u0026quot;the master of all genres.\u0026quot; Since the 1950s when French critics such as Francois Truffaut began to make the case, Hawks has been generally accepted as one of greatest directors of all time, yet he is much less well known to day than his contemporaries John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock, perhaps because each of them was closely identified with a single genre. Hawks is probably best remembered for romantic comedies such as His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby, and for a pair of films he made in the 1940s with Humphrey Bogart, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep. But, he also made war pictures (Dawn Patrol), action-adventure stories (Only Angels Have Wings), musicals (Gentlemen Prefer Blonds), Westerns (Red River), one of the great gangster films, the original Scarface, and even Biblical epic. He is often credited as the auteur of sci-fi movie he produced. Hawks was known as for making movies that commented on others in the same genre, as his Western Rio Bravo does of Fred Zinnemann\u0027s High Noon. We will use Hawks\u0027s film to understand Hollywood genres in formal, cultural, and economic terms. Most weeks we will watch one film by Hawks and one film in the same genre by another director.

Often, behind a foreign accent, we encounter an entirely different worldview. The same word or phrase in English might actually carry very distinct connotations for someone whose native language is French, German, Russian, or Japanese. Can we learn to anticipate, understand, and become sensitive to these connotations? How can we mend potential miscommunications that might arise due to these conceptual differences?

In this course, we?ll explore the casuistical or case-based method of argument commonly used in law, business, and public policy schools and in various moral and ethical contexts including medical and bioethics, as well as the case study research methodology frequently used in the social sciences and practice-oriented disciplines such as law, business, and education.

We see this, for example, in the increasing use of narrative in journalism, in the presentation of controversial historical events, in current political debates about immigration reform, and in workplace communication. In these contexts, narratives function as a source of authority and legitimation. To understand this function, we will discuss several key concepts in narrative theory, and then apply them to several case studies. We will look at how immigrant narratives circulating in the United States create stock images of immigrants as a threat; at how politicians use autobiographical narration to claim authority; and at how workplace narratives establish roles, boundaries, and power relations.

At the same time you will develop a portfolio of methods that track the constructive, inferential process of readers? comprehension. In the second half of the course we turn to you and your own writing as a thinking process engaged in the constant effort to juggle competing goals. You will gain insight into your current problem-solving strategies and develop new ones for doing reader-based writing and design. The final project (which studies your own process on a current writing task) will expand your portfolio of methods into a toolkit of expert strategies for 1) both composing and communication and for 2) user testing and inquiry into the comprehension of real readers that uncovers how others actually interpret what you thought you said.","title":"Process of Reading and Writing"},{"courseId":"76827","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1584,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"In Teaching Writing as Reflective Practice, George Hillocks identifies good teachers as those who treat their classrooms as sites of inquiry by constantly interrogating assumptions about what students need, experimenting with new techniques and strategies in order to meet those needs, and critically assessing whether these strategies are successful. In this seminar, we will implement Hillocks\u0027 philosophy by learning to think about our pedagogy as a research project, asking such questions as - What do students need to learn about writing? Are our classes helping students gain these skills? - Do new advances in technology offer us new ways to improve our instruction? - How do students use (or not use) the knowledge they gain in writing classes in future contexts? - What unique needs do various groups of students have (e.g. students with learning disabilities, students from different linguistic or cultural backgrounds) that our pedagogy should work to accommodate? We will read recent research seeking to answer these questions and discuss how we can contribute to these conversations. In other words, we will focus both on learning about existing research and on producing research of our own. We will learn how to identify researchable questions, develop methods and research designs for answering those questions, and dig through the evidence we collect to come to more nuanced understandings of the questions we sought to answer.

How are they similar and how different? What was it like to live in America when the unemployment rate reached above 20%? How did writers, filmmakers, and other artists respond? This course will focus on American culture and society from the stock market crash of 1929 through the beginning of World War II. We will read literature, see films, and consider other artistic productions, and and we will also read social, economic, and political history. The 1930s in the U.S. saw a flourishing of the realism of proletarian fiction and the emergence of a new wave of naturalists such as Richard Wright and John Steinbeck. The rise of industrial unions produced what Michael Denning has defined as a \u0026quot;cultural front,\u0026quot; involving the first popular interest in American folk music and mass media representations of the working class. But the 1930s also saw the rise of the major studios and radio networks into what was later called \u0026quot;the culture industry,\u0026quot; and we will look at how those industries both addressed and diverted attention from the economic crisis. We will also consider at least briefly the relations of the U.S. and the rest of the world, looking especially at the rise of fascism and Hitler, the role of the Soviet Union in the international Communist movement, and the Spanish Civil War where these two forces fought it out with each other.","title":"American Culture of the Great Depression"},{"courseId":"76841","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1586,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"We will read most of Chaucer\u0027s Canterbury Tales in Middle English; his language is odd-looking and may ruin your spelling temporarily, but easily mastered.

As a published author, foreign correspondent and Pulitzer-Prize winning editor, the instructor has been a foot soldier in print journalism and media management for 30 years. The practical emphasis of the course reflects his extensive and varied background. The course focuses on the four stages necessary to any nonfiction story: idea, concept, reporting and writing. Subjects include how to make news judgments, gather evidence, make word choices, compose stories and interpret events, unpacking the language and vocabulary of the craft of journalism. As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalism?s glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print.

If you want to understand the world today and where it might be heading, it?s crucial not only to think globally but also to relate current global processes to comparable processes in the past. This course offers you several options for expanding on the skills you need to think globally through the medium of history. As their descriptions indicate, the differently titled lectures vary in their subject matter and the particular pathways they provide for exploring global processes. However, they all involve a mix of lectures and recitations; they have similar amounts of reading; and they all use essay writing as the primary medium of assessment. Most importantly, they all strive to help you: (1) identify and assess the varied ways that scholars interpret global interactions as they unfold through time; (2) bring together insights from diverse fields in the humanities and social sciences to illuminate the development of global connections, differences, and divisions; (3) read, listen, discuss, take notes, and craft written arguments supported by different kinds of evidence; and, above all, (4) use explorations in global histories to engage the workings of the world today and in the future.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, as pursued by Lewis Hine, while the other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz, founder of the elite Photo-Secession movement in the United States, who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul. As such they were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W.

This consensus follows from a history of three centuries during which, across the entire world, nation states have established systems of formal education. That these systems have much in common follows, in part, from the fact that in good measure they have been attentively copied from one another, sometimes under duress, sometimes not. Of course, when we compare formal education as offered in the many societies in the world, we find intriguing differences. No less important are the many uniformities in education across the world, and the many agencies that promote the expansion of these uniformities.

The user research phase begins with students conducting contextual inquiries and background research to understand the nature and needs of the customer/user and tasks relevant to their problem. Based on that understanding, students go through an innovation phase producing product ideas situated to meet the identified needs. With strong sponsor input, they narrow down their ideas and select one or more to pursue further. Then, over the summer, students engage in a prototyping and user-testing phase where they produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design.

Information and communication technologies play multiple roles within an organizational context: ? From a technological perspective they define the information and communication infrastructure of the firm and they enable new ways to digitize business processes. ? From a managerial perspective they facilitate new coordination and communication within and across entities enable new organizational forms change the information environment underlying the business and permit new incentive structures. Successful efforts at digitization have to keep both technological and managerial perspectives in mind. Using a collection of cases this course will study how the deployment of information technology changes interactions and processes within organizations across organizations within industries and across society. The case analyses will require students to engage in both technical and managerial problem solving. The technical component of the analysis requires students to propose IT architectures for the problems highlighted in the case. The managerial component of the analysis requires students to analyze the business value of the proposed solution and address the change management issues that arise in implementing any digital transformation initiative.\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/academic-resources/course-results/course-details/index.aspx?cid\u003d308\"\u003e...Read More\u003c/a\u003e","title":"Digital Transformation"},{"courseId":"95725","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1821,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"","title":"Basics of Financial Statement Literacy"},{"courseId":"95726","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1822,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"","title":"Fundamentals of Finance"},{"courseId":"95732","treeType":"OR","nodeId":1823,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"In this course we analyze what happens to marketing practice when cheap and powerful computers and communication networks are used to mediate markets.

Conveniently a range of technologies and products cumulatively known as Business Intelligence (BI) come to the rescue. The BI solutions therefore aim at two main goals: firstly at optimizing the efficiency of decision making by human managers and secondly at maximizing the utilization of the available data (so that no important clue is ever missed). The term of BI is used in reference to a variety of tasks (such as reporting monitoring alerting data aggregation ad-hoc querying forecasting) function-specific applications (such as enterprise resource planning enterprise risk modeling customer relationship management corporate dashboards and so on) as well as underlying technologies (including computing hardware telecommunication infrastructure database management data warehousing data mining and so on). The analytic component of BI attracts a growing attention of their current and prospective users. The trend stems from the attainable competitive advantage which can be realized by effectively using of analytics in the context of the generally defined Business Intelligence.

These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation. Topics include: Zipf\u0027s distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information; decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

Through an examination of the ways in which contemporary bodies illustrate these issues in both Spain and Latin America, we might better understand the problems and complications within the issues. From the performances of Coco Fusco to the poems of Ana Rosetti, this course will look at contemporary artistic expressions to arrive at a better understanding of a corporeal politics of resistance. The types of resistance will be important to consider. For example, are the bodies resisting stereotypes? Are they resisting political violence? Moreover, how are the communications of these bodies different within the transatlantic contexts in which they find themselves? And, subsequently, are those geographic anchors important? The class will be student-centered, and thus highly interactive.

It then addresses the cinema of Hitler?s so-called ?Third Reich,? when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways. In the final week of the semester, we will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest. The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called ?New German Cinema? of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood. Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No knowledge of the German language is required for this course; most of the films will be in German with English subtitles. The course will be cross-listed in the departments of Modern Languages, English, and History.

While its popularity continues to grow among its readers, its wide circulation also raises questions among scholars and critics of traditional Chinese literature and culture. Two questions are usually brought up in the discussion of the value of this comic book series: (1) Are the comic adaptations faithful to the meanings of the original Chinese works? (2) Does the popularity of this comic series really help to promote the understanding and transmission of traditional Chinese culture? One goal of this course is to look into these two questions. In this course, students will be asked to read Tsai Chih Chung?s comic books and their animated adaptations, as well as the English translations of the Chinese canonical texts of philosophy and literature.

People have a variety of ways of communicating their ideas in social interaction. Among many expressions, they choose particular ones based on who they are talking to, and under what situation the conversation is taking place. The contextual factors, along with knowledge of communication conventions, also help people comprehend messages that are often indirectly conveyed. Hence, learning a second language (L2) involves more than learning a system of grammar and lexis. Understanding the rules of speaking and the social situations of the conversation in addition to grammatical rules are important factors in order to become a fully competent speaker in the target language culture. This course aims to enhance students? understanding of pragmatics in their every day communication, as well as challenges and opportunities that learners face in the course of their L2 pragmatic development. The first part of the course helps students develop techniques to analyze how people perform pragmatic functions in real life communication. The techniques are drawn from frameworks within traditional pragmatic theories and conversation analysis. The second part of the course examines the application of pragmatic theories to SLA research in three broad domains: pragmatic constructs \u0026amp; research methods, development of pragmatic competence, and pedagogical issues.

People have a variety of ways of communicating their ideas in social interaction. Among many expressions, they choose particular ones based on who they are talking to, and under what situation the conversation is taking place. The contextual factors, along with knowledge of communication conventions, also help people comprehend messages that are often indirectly conveyed. Hence, learning a second language (L2) involves more than learning a system of grammar and lexis. Understanding the rules of speaking and the social situations of the conversation in addition to grammatical rules are important factors in order to become a fully competent speaker in the target language culture. This course aims to enhance students? understanding of pragmatics in their every day communication, as well as challenges and opportunities that learners face in the course of their L2 pragmatic development. The first part of the course helps students develop techniques to analyze how people perform pragmatic functions in real life communication. The techniques are drawn from frameworks within traditional pragmatic theories and conversation analysis. The second part of the course examines the application of pragmatic theories to SLA research in three broad domains: pragmatic constructs \u0026amp; research methods, development of pragmatic competence, and pedagogical issues.

How can such physical objects be used to create or transmit meaning? The answer assumed in this course is that objects with specific physical features are assigned symbolic or linguistic values on the basis of those features. By the juxtaposition of such objects (phonemes or graphemes), larger symbolic objects are created (morphemes). Morphemes have the special property that they can be associated in a consistent way with meanings. In a progressive fashion, words are built from morphemes, phrases from words, and sentences from phrases. Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on.

The criterion used by private sector producers in solving similar allocation problems is profit maximization. The analogue in the public sector is maximization of net social benefits. Since it is usually quite difficult to measure theses net benefits indeed it is often very hard even to know what to measure and since the political process does not normally provide clear cut signals for most governmental undertakings it is difficult to know whether the projects contemplated are worthwhile. The content of cost benefit analysis may be thought of as an attempt to answer a series of questions: 1. What are the rationales for government projects? 2. What is (or should be) a government\u0027s objective? 3. Whose social benefits and social costs is the analyst measuring? 4. What is a social cost and what is a social benefit? These questions constitute the heart of the course and lead to such topics as consumer surplus and producer surplus shadow prices (i.e. the value of something like life itself for which the market provides little or no guidance regarding quantifiable value) and externalities or indirect effects. 5. Since many government programs have costs and benefits spread over time how does this affect the analysis? 6. How does one cope with uncertainty? Not every topic will be discussed in depth.

This course will introduce students to the complex structure of federal agencies working on trade and international investment issues. It will outline some of the major trade conflicts and negotiations the U.S. federal government is currently engaged in. Most importantly the course will involve Heinz students directly in the work of one or more of these agencies by allowing our students to work on analyses and background research connected to a current policy issue. This undertaking will involve direct interaction with U.S. federal policymakers. The only prerequisite for the course is Applied Economic Analysis but students should be prepared to make extra effort to acquire understanding of such basic international economics frameworks and analytical tools as the course and the tasks provided to our students by federal trade agencies require.

Many students find this course to be helpful as background for other health care elective courses. This course will include: Lectures and extensive textbook readings to familiarize students with health systems financial management functions. Historical perspectives will include a macroeconomic overview of health expenditures and the evolution of third-party payors. Detailed review of current payment and reimbursement systems for providers and insurers including Medicare and Medical Assistance. Lectures by guest speakers who will share their experiences in applying financial management theories within various health care situations.

Through the use of actual data guest speakers from Children\u0027s management and a major healthcare insurance company students will develop an understanding of the challenges that were faced by the hospital over the past decade. As the sole pediatric facility in the area Children\u0027s experienced positive financial results and little competition until the early 1990\u0027s. This was the result of increased penetration of managed care into the region and insurance companies purchasing physician practices. Children\u0027s responded like many facilities by attempting to cut costs and buy practices in order to protect market share. What occurred is that such actions caused further deterioration in the financial results. Fiscal Year 1997 produced the worst financial results in the hospital\u0027s history causing the Board to take drastic actions. What followed was during a five year period operating results improved by approximately $25 million as a result of changing leadership going back to business-basics and creating a greater sense of accountability throughout the organization. Although Children\u0027s will be used as a case study the topics discussed are applicable to any healthcare institution. Advance work will include financial statement review and analysis. The on-campus classroom sessions will include guest speakers and discussion of real life challenges experienced at Children\u0027s Hospital over the last 10 years.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computerized systems designed for the storage retrieval and analysis of geographically referenced data. GIS maps all sorts of physical biological cultural demographic and economic data. The roots of GIS are in cartography and go back hundreds of years. GIS as we know it today began in the 1950s and 1960s and for many years was used primarily by government agencies and engineers. Why are so many health care executives and public health professionals now seeing the benefits of managing their organizations through the use of GIS? The answer is quite simple: managing health care costs by efficiently meeting patient needs with available resources is an activity that is central to every health care organization. GIS provides an effective way to visualize organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical data social services and patient data. Public health and medical research agencies are also using GIS to map health-related events identify disease clusters investigate environmental health problems and understand the spread of communicable and infectious disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It imbeds learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes a lecture and computer lab that focuses on a health care issue which uses ArcView GIS from ESRI Inc. to analyze data or solve a problem.

Your instructor spent nearly 14 years working in the U.S. Congress and still does not pretend to know with certainty the rhyme and reason of this institution. But trying to understand legislative policy-making is essential for every student of public policy and management. In a democratic society all the great ideas in the world mean nothing if you cannot persuade those in legislative office not only to accept your proposals but also to enact them into law. Thousands of bills are introduced in the U.S. Congress every year but only a few hundred are ever enacted. What is the key to effective policy-making in the United States? Why do some ideas become law and most do not? The focus of this course is the U.S. Congress and all the components that dictate whether a particular proposal becomes law. We will examine how the elected official\u0027s desires both political and otherwise interact with the goals of his colleagues special interest groups staff members the media and the legislative process to create legislation.

But approving or legislating the most enlightened public policy or program does not guarantee that it will be implemented in an effective way -- or even in the way intended by the policy maker. Rarely are the people who make public policy decisions the ones who implement those decisions. In a democratic government saying it is does not make it so! This course is designed to study review and analyze policy implementation in the public sector. This is a look at government bureaucracy! In a democratic society how does one effectively get from the declaration of a policy to its implementation particularly when implementation has been such a low priority for our elected officials? Implementation involves the complex interactions of many elements: translating ideas into workable programs; making decisions for both program design and operation; communicating with both constituencies and affected decision-makers; overcoming the resistance of bureaucrats; and assessing and evaluating the results. Examples of programs and policies will be used throughout the course. Each student as a member of a team will develop an implementation plan for a selected policy or program.

Such systems embed computing elements, integrate sensors and actuators, operate in a reliable and timely fashion, and demand rigorous engineering from conception through production. Applications of robotics technology will be used to illustrate applications and the challenges in engineering complex systems. Concepts, problems, and methods of systems engineering are introduced and discussed in lectures and developed in assignments. Case studies and guest lectures present best practice in the field. Readings from current literature will tie theory to practical methods of creating complex devices.

They are not simply complicated; they arise as interacting agents create various feedbacks that result in, often unintentional, emergent phenomena. Confronting these challenges requires an understanding of the properties of complex systems. In this course, we will provide an overview of complex systems theory and concepts. You will learn the fundamental properties of complex adaptive systems and how to apply these insights to a variety of key social science problems. We will introduce and analyze computational and mathematical models, as well as qualitative models, so you should have some familiarity with basic probability and algebra.

The Project may also be done in very small teams established with the mentors in advance of beginning the project. All the people on the team must have completed the core courses in the MSIT Program prior to beginning the Project. The Project can be completed on or off campus. Summary of steps for a Project: . Propose a project using the defined formal format provided. In the proposal you will provide: (1) An Executive summary (2) Definition of the work to be completed, which will include: (a) Deliverables (b) Time lines (c) Two Reviews (mid point presentation and Final presentation) (d) Final report . Discuss the project with a designated faculty mentor . Discuss the project with a technical mentor (Certain requirements must be met by your technical advisor, speak to your mentor) . Get your proposal signed off (The CMU director faculty mentor and your technical mentor will approve your Project proposal.) . Begin the project, reporting periodically to the faculty mentor and workplace mentor. Another form of project is to subcontract with a MSE team to provide deliverables. This option would be primarily available to on campus MSIT students. The project will be an independent part of the MSE project which must be deliverable if the MSE project fails.

Analysis is the systematic examination of an artifact to determine its properties. This course will focus on analysis of software artifacts--primarily code, but also including analysis of designs, architectures, and test suites. We will focus on functional properties, but also cover non-functional properties like performance and security. In order to illustrate core analysis concepts in some depth, the course will center on static program analysis; however, the course will also include a breadth of techniques such as testing, model checking, theorem proving, dynamic analysis, and type systems. Concern for realistic and economical application of analysis will also be evident in a bias towards analyses that are scalable and incremental. The course emphasizes the fundamental similarities between analyses (in their mechanism and power) to teach the students the limitations and scope of the analyses, rather than the distinctions that arose historically (static vs. dynamic, code vs. spec). The course will balance theoretical discussions with lab exercises in which students will apply the ideas they are learning to real artifacts. After completing this course, students will: * know what kinds of analyses are available and how to use them * understand their scope and power, when they can be applied and what conclusions can be drawn from their results * have a grasp of fundamental notions sufficient to evaluate new kinds of analysis when they are developed * have some experience selecting and writing analyses for a real piece of software, applying them and interpreting the results In addition, Ph.D. students taking the 17-754 version of the course will gain a broad overview of the analysis research literature and in-depth knowledge of a particular sub-area through a course project.","title":"Analysis of Software Artifacts"},{"courseId":"17755","treeType":"OR","nodeId":2794,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"This course is cross-listed with 17-655, Architectures for Software Systems.

We see how interest rate policy offsets fluctuations in inflation and employment that occur otherwise due to macroeconomic shocks. And we see why inflation targeting is welfare-maximizing monetary policy. We see how a central bank implements interest rate policy in practice through its influence on bank lending and money stock determination. We discuss the implementation and effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy at the zero interest bound. We distinguish banking from bond and equity finance in the capital markets. We discuss how money markets grew in size with the help of depository institution sponsors, securitization, structured finance, and regulatory permissiveness to rival the volume of credit intermediated through the banking system. We see how money markets helped to create the credit turmoil of 2007-2009. We see that significantly higher bank capital requirements are not costly from the social point of view, and that they are the best regulatory means of maintaining the health and stability of the financial system. We assess central banking in the recent credit turmoil by classifying core central bank initiatives into monetary policy, credit policy, and interest on reserves policy.

Historically, ?operations? have been the main application area for operations research or management science techniques (hence the name operations research), especially in the areas related to scheduling, manufacturing, and logistics processes of a company. Currently these traditional problems and the associated solution techniques, enjoy much extensive, and quite successful, application areas in real life, including healthcare, public policy, marketing, telecommunication, finance, and even biotechnology. Consequently, informed decision making, based on mathematical models and solution techniques, has become essential for successful implementation of operations at wide range of organizations. This course focuses on the use of optimization techniques to aid the decision making for typical operations problems while covering cutting-edge real-life applications in a wide range of application areas, to exemplify the applicability of the skills you will learn in this class in different settings. The course consists of two pillars: i) applying general modeling and solving techniques, e.g., integer linear programming, to operations, and ii) studying prototypical applications of operations in detail. The primary objectives of this course are to allow the student to: * understand the role of operations in a business, industrial, or governmental environment, * recognize the difficulty, challenges, and potential of operations problems, * apply mathematical tools to model and solve operations problems.

Therefore we will first compare and contrast the ideas of various quality ?gurus,? examining the different ways to define and measure quality. In most cases, the goal should be to design and maintain a process which is in statistical control, producing with the ?best? nominal value, and with a minimum of variation. How to determine what is ?best? is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider some of the issues surrounding successful adoption of quality improvement initiatives ? finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs, including six sigma. We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools supporting quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics ? the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class. We will conclude with a focused discussion of specific six-sigma ideas and techniques, exploring its similarities and differences as compared to traditional quality programs. At the conclusion of the course you will understand the six-sigma framework, and be very comfortablewith its technical tools.

Since facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name, a supply chain describes a network of facilities and links. Supply chain management (SCM) includes the strategic design of this network and choice of its capacity; the tactical planning of this capacity and related management of production, inventory, and logistics activities; and the operational control of the flows of materials, information, and money and the stocks of physical goods in this network. The goal of SCM is to maximize the economic value that can be generated by managing these decisions. Depending on the context, this may involve an objective of profit/margin maximization or cost minimization. Typically, economic value maximization is associated with matching the supply of products with its demand: excess supply is too costly, inadequate supply irritates customers. Information technology and systems, such as radio frequency identification tags, enterprise resource planning systems, and advanced planning and inventory optimization systems greatly facilitate this task. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from supply and/or demand uncertainty, has been attached to supply chains ? either to quantify the risk of supply/demand mismatch, or the risk involved due to a potential disruption of the supply chain (due to natural or man-made factors). Flexibility and responsiveness are useful strategies and tactics to manage supply chain risk. This course explores how firms can make better SCM choices.

Operations strategy involves configuring and developing resources \u0026amp; processes used to design, produce, distribute, and deliver goods and/or services. Operations strategy differs from corporate/business strategy in that it is less about industries and choosing a competitive position, but more about enabling the execution of corporate/business strategy (i.e., how to best deliver the value proposition). Obviously, operations strategy must build on good understanding of day-to-day operations management. Thus, this course will involve both quantitative analysis of firms? operations processes and qualitative assessment of firms? operations strategies. Specifically, the course will consist of the following four parts: (1) Introduction to operations strategy, (2) Process management and strategy, covering process analysis and project management tools, (3) Resource planning and strategy, including decisions on capacity size, timing, types (specialized/flexible) and location (off/on-shoring), and (4) Strategic outsourcing and related issues in global supply chains and corporate social responsibility.

Many strategies are empirical. A portfolio manager notices (looks for!) a pattern in the data such as small firms have higher average returns. For example, stock returns in January or Friday seem, on average, higher. Other strategies are ?behavioral.? Managers notice (search for) institutional or intellectual frictions that lead (or ought to lead) to oddly priced assets. For example, one might posit, that ?exciting? high-growth firms with little tangible assets tweak individuals? tendency to be overly optimistic and hence they are good stocks to sell. In practice, both techniques are used to develop trading strategies. Evaluating trading strategies is also challenging. A portfolio trading strategy generates returns. Loosely speaking, the returns have three components that are hard to disentangle. - ?epsilon? - A large part of returns is just luck. Stock returns are, as you know, stunningly volatile. - ?beta? - there is a risk premium to be earned for bearing risk. The equity risk premium, for example, implies you will earn more money investing in stocks rather than bonds. However, this premium is compensation for the higher risk in stocks. One topic we will discuss in detail is how we measure risk in financial makets (?benchmarking?). It turns out risk is much more complicated than the simple CAPM suggests - ?alpha? - Risk adjusted expected return. Once you average out the epsilons and adjust for the beta-risk, what is left-over is alpha. The big question: Is the pattern we find in the data spurious (?epsilon?), an aspect of risk (?beta?) or have we found that thing we seek (?alpha?). My view? I am skeptical.

We begin by discussing the utility-based approach to decision making (which includes EUT, Prospect Theory, etc.), and consider its main strengths and limitations. This initial analysis will motivate the main themes, questions, and goals of the course. Most of the course will be dedicated to the careful identification, comparison, and critique of non-utility theories. Among the theories we will examine are: Reason-Based Choice, the Priority Heuristic, Query Theory, Decision by Sampling, and several others. We will consider each theory\u0027s potential for advancing our ability to model and understand human decision making, as well as its limitations and some possible solutions to these limitations. The main goal of the course is to expose students to these alternative approaches and consider their potential (or lack thereof) for moving us beyond the limitations associated with utility-based approaches. As part of the course, students will apply one (or more) of these theories to their existing research projects/questions, as a means of acquiring \u0026quot;hands on\u0026quot; experience with utility-free approaches and learning to use them in their own research and theorizing.","title":"Utility-Free Theories of Decision Making"},{"courseId":"47744","treeType":"OR","nodeId":2996,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"","title":"Analytical and Structural Marketing Models"},{"courseId":"47745","treeType":"OR","nodeId":2997,"isStarter":true,"prereqIndices":[],"postreqIndices":[],"prereqLinks":[],"postreqLinks":[],"description":"Dynamic Structural Models in Marketing \u0026amp; Economics: This course introduces some recent developments on estimating dynamic structural models in marketing \u0026amp; economics.
